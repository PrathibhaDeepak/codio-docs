title: Remove members


---

There are some occasions where you may want to remove old members in order to make room for new members - for example if a class of students leaves and you want to use the account licences for other students.

To remove members:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane

1. Under **Permanent Teams**, Click **All Members**

1. You will be able to see all the members of your school organization.
1. Choose **Remove** on the right hand side of the name of the person who you want to remove from your organization.


1. If you want to use the freed-up accounts with new students, follow the steps listed in [Add Users](/classes/classmanagement/addstudents)
