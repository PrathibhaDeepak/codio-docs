summary: How to manage teachers in your organization

Once you have set up your organization, the next step is to invite teachers to use Codio too. There are 2 ways you can do this:

# Invite Teacher to the Organization

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane

    ![Profile](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click the name of your organization (under **My Organizations**)
![Org Name](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the **Members** tab
![Members](/img/manage_organization/memberstab.png)

1. In the  **Invite Teacher to the Organization** area, enter in their email address. If you also wish them to have full [access](/dashboard/create/adminrole/) rights to the organization, check the **Add this teacher to owners group**.
![Invite Teacher](/img/manage_organization/inviteteacher.png)

1. An email will be sent to your colleague containing a link to sign up and on completion they will be added into your Organization automatically.
**N.B.** They must use the email address the invitation was sent to or they will not be added to the Organization.

1. Any invitations not completed will show in the area below and where you can also **Resend** or **Revoke** if you require. Once the invitee has joined the organization they will no longer show in this area but show in the **All Members** list below (and also **Owners** list if 'Add this teacher to owners group' was checked)

# Invitation Token

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
![Profile](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click the name of your organization (under **My Organizations**)
![Org name](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the **Organization Settings** tab
![Org settings](/img/manage_organization/orgsettingstab.png)

1. About half way down you will see an **Invitation** area, displaying an **Invite URL** and an **Invite token**.
![Add Teachers](/img/class_administration/addteachers/invitation.png)

1. Give any teachers who are not already Codio users the invite URL.

1. When they enter the URL in their browser, they will automatically be taken through the sign-up process and as they select that they are a Teacher, will then be added to your Organization.

1. Alternatively, teachers can register themselves for a Codio account by following the sign-up process at www.codio.com. Once they have done this (selecting that they are a **Teacher**, they will be asked for an **Invite token** to join your educational organization. This is provided in step 4 above - give them the token (not the URL).

1. If you already have classes set up you can add and invite teachers directly into your class(es). See [Adding teachers to a class](/classes/classmanagement/addteachers)

You can then if you wish add them as an [organization owner](/dashboard/create/addowners) so they can then manage and create classes themselves and have full admin access to the organization
