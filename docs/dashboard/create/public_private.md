Organization owners can disable this feature to allow members of the Organization to create Public Projects/Stacks/Starter Packs/Courses and Modules. By default, these will be created as Private.


Private projects can still be shared to other users in the normal manner. See [Permissions](/ide/customization/permissions/)


**N.B.** Any existing Projects/Stacks/Starter Packs/Courses and Modules created by members of the organization prior to any changes being made will not be effected

To enable the creation of Public Projects/Stacks/Starter Packs/Courses and Modules, access the administration tools:

1. Click on your profile picture (bottom left of **Classes**)

1. Click the name of your institution (under **My Organizations**)
