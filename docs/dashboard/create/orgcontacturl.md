title: Organisation Contact URL


---

If you wish to set your own contact URL's for your students (e.g. you have a forum or LMS discussion area for them to use or you have your own resources available to assist students), you can do so in the following way:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
![profile](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under **My Organizations**, which is about halfway down the screen.
![organisation](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the **Organization settings** tab
![organisation settings](/img/manage_organization/orgsettingstab.png)

1. Go to the **Education Settings** section toward the  bottom of the page, and enter the text you wish to show along with the URL you wish to direct your students to. You can set as many options as you require and also define the default option that will be checked automatically for the students.

1. If these are set, when a student uses any of the ways to contact us, they will be shown all the options in addition to contacting Codio directly if they have a problem accessing the Codio platform, or loading a unit can contact us.

1. These can also be set at the [class](/classes/classmanagement/classcontacturl) level so if you have specific areas/forums for your classes for students to raise questions, you can set the contact URL there and it will override the organisation setting

**N.B. "Teacher" accounts will not be effected by this setting and they will still be able to contact Codio in the usual manner. See [Support](/dashboard/support/) for more on this**
