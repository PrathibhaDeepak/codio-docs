title: View Organization members

Sometimes you might need to check who is registered as a member of your educational organization. To view all members of your school organization follow these steps:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under **My Organizations**, which is about halfway down the screen.
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the **Members** tab
![authtoken](/img/manage_organization/memberstab.png)

1. Click **All Members**
![authtoken](/img/manage_organization/members.png)

You will be able to see all the members of your school organization.

The **Test Students** group contains the demo student accounts created for you when the Organization was created. See [Create Organization](/dashboard/create/createorg/) for more information.

The **Users without class** group contains all users that are not members of a class. See [Delete Class](/classes/classmanagement/delete) for more information.  This may be as a result of a class being deleted or it may be that a new user has joined your organization but is not yet either a Teacher or a Student in a class.
Select this group and you can then remove these users from your organization if required.

Please note that removing users from your Organization does not delete their Codio account. Only the account owner can [delete their account](/dashboard/account/delete).
