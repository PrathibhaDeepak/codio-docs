Organization owners can manage the student dashboard view by setting their default page to 'My Projects' as an alternative to **My Classroom** as well as optionally hiding **My Classroom** and **Courses** menu items.

To do this, access the administration tools:

1. Click on your profile picture (bottom left of **Classes**)
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)
1. Click the name of your institution (under **My Organizations**)
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)
1. You will see admin options listed across the top of the page.

**N.B.** Your students may need to reload Codio in their browser when they next log in for the changes to be visible to them

Access for students to individual courses can also be managed in the course permissions. See [Restrict Course access](/courses/manage/restrict-access) for more information.
