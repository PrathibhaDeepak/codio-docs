title: Remove owners


---

You may want to remove one or more of the owners you have set for your organization. It is worth noting that you always need at least one owner. (If you want to know how to add owners, jump to [add organization owners](/dashboard/create/addowners/)).

To remove owners:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
