title: "Joining a class"

---

If your class is working with an LMS platform such as Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle etc. then you will access Codio directly from it.

If you are not using and LMS then your instructor should have given you one of the following ways of joining.


- If your teacher has sent you an Invitation URL, copy/paste that into your browser.

- If your teacher has sent you a 2 word token, go to **[Join Class](https://codio.com/p/join-class)** button on our website and enter the class token.

To access your class after this point, log in to your Codio account and go to the [My Classroom](/dashboard/student/myclassroom) area
