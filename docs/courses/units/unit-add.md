title: Adding units


---

A unit behaves like a Codio project except it will not appear in your projects list. This makes it much easier to find your unit as well as to chronologically arrange the units within each module.

You can mix book units and project units in a course module.

If you have already have a regular project that you want to load into a unit, then the process is described below.

## Adding a new unit
You add a new unit by pressing the large blue **+** button. You now need to choose between

- a project unit
- a book unit

[Click here](/content/authoring/3ways) if you are not sure about the difference between project units and book units.

# New project unit
You can create a new unit in the following ways.

- Create a brand new unit as you would with a normal Codio project.
- Import an existing project into the unit. See the image below and read the contents of the **Important** box. A snapshot of the selected project is taken. From that point on you will edit from the unit, not the project.
- Import from other sources such as GitHub/BitBucket/Mercurial etc. by selecting the **Import** option.

With book units, students can look at any part of the book even when assigned a single book unit. This is ideal for referring back to material covered previously and for general revision and can be set in the class. See [Book Visibility](/classes/classmanagement/bookvisibility)] for more information.
