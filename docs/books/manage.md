### Creating a new book
Creating a new book is done from the main books screen. Press the large blue **New Book** button in the top right of the screen.

You will get the same options for creating a book as for a project, so you can start from scratch or import from a project or a Git repo. You also have control over visibility as with projects and courses.

### Editing a book in the IDE
Once the book has been created, you can edit the book in the IDE by clicking on the book.

### Editing a book's settings
Modify a book's settings by clicking on the gear icon.

### Deleting a book
You can delete a book by clicking on the gear icon and then pressing the **Delete** button.
