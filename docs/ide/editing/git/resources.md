If you are new to Git, then here are some resources to get you started.

- [Git is simpler than you think](http://nfarina.com/post/9868516270/git-is-simpler) (this is worth reading as it explains HOW Git works rather than teaching you usage)
- [Git reference](http://git-scm.com/docs)
- [Introduction to Git by Scott Chacon](http://git-scm.com/book)

Here is a list of more Git Tutorials in case you want some choice
