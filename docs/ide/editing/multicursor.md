title: Multiple cursors


---

You can place multiple cursors anywhere in a file using `Cmd+Click` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Click` (PC/Linux).

Click to place the cursor at the desired location, then press and hold Cmd/Ctrl and begin clicking at new locations. When you release Cmd/Ctrl, you can start typing and the content will be duplicated at all cursor locations.

You can also use `Alt-Click` to place the cursor everywhere inbetween a start and end position.
