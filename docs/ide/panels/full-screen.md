title: Expand Tabs full screen


---

If you have multiple panels open, you may find that you like the arrangement but some of the panels are too small for code editing.

Full screen mode is activated by selecting a tab and then pressing (by default) `F11`. You can shrink it back into the tab by pressing `F11` again.

Some Mac users may find that F11 is blocked. You can easily modify the keyboard shortcut in [Codio Preferences](/ide/customization/codio-prefs).
