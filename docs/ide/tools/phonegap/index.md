You access Codio's **Phonegap:Build** features from the **Tools->Phonegap** menu.

Our Phonegap support provides a comfortable integration with Adobe's Phonegap Build platform. You should first create an account at [http://build.phonegap.com](http://build.phonegap.com).

**Note:** At the time of writing, the **PhoneGap:Build** free plan supports a maximum project size of 50MB and 1000MB or 1GB for paid plans. Account plan details can be found [here](https://build.phonegap.com/plans).
