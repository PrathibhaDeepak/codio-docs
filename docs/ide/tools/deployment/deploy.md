title: Deploying to a Target


---

There are three ways to deploy projects.



## Tools->Deployment->Deploy menu
This let's you deploy to any of your deployment targets you created in [Manage Targets](/ide/tools/deployment/create). You are shown a log if any errors occur.

## Right Click in the file tree
You can deploy an individual file or folder by right-clicking in the file tree.


## Command Line
You can use the command line directly but you can also add your custom deployment actions by [modifying the Run Menu](/ide/boxes/runmenu/).
