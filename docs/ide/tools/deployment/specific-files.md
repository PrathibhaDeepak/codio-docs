title: Deploying specific files & folders


---

If you are using a 3rd party hosting provider that does not support RSYNC (the recommended approach), then you can avoid Codio deploying your entire project by only deploying the files or folders that you specify.

Select any files and folders from the file tree and then use the right-click menu to deploy them.

All defined deployment targets will be listed in the submenu. Click the target you want to deploy to.
