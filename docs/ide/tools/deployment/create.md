title: Create/manage a target

The Manage Targets options are accessed via **Tools > Deployment > Manage Targets** menu. All Deployment dialogs will be displayed in the currently active [Panel](/ide/panels).

If you have not yet created any deployment targets then you will be prompted to create one.
