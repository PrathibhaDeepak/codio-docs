title: "Forking a Project"

You can fork any 3rd party public project into your account going to `Project>Fork`. If you are looking at a forked project, then it will look like this.

If you are signed into Codio, forking a project will create the fork in your account.

If the project owner has allowed box cloning you will also be able to clone the box as well as the project.
