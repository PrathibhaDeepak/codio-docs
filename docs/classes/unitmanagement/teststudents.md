Codio automatically creates 3 test students for you. This allows instructors to view the student experience when units are assigned to classes.

1.  They can be seen in the members section. If there are not 3 student listed then you can regenerate them from this screen.

If your class is LMS integrated then you will need to perform your testing from the LMS and not use the Codio test students.
