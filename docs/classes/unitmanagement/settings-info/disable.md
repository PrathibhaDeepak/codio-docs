title: Disable/enable units


---

You can enable or disable units that have been assigned to a class. This is useful when your students are working in controlled assessment conditions and you only want them to have access to their work within a prescribed timeframe.

You can also specify in the main settings tab whether the student has no access or read-only access to the project when the Unit is disabled. You can find this setting in the **Units** section on the settings screen.
