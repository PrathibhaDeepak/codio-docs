**This option will destroy all student work.**

In the event that a unit in your course/classes is updated and, for some reason, you cannot use the [Update course](/classes/unitmanagement/upgradecourse) option, you can reset it so **all** students, including those who have already started the unit, are updated with the new unit.

You can reset the unit for all your students by selecting either

- the **Actions** button and then the **Reset** button

or

- you can reset the unit for individual students from the 3 blue dot menu
