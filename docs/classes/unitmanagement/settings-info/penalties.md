title: Set unit penalties
description: ""


---

You can specify penalties in the event that students do not complete the unit within agreed timescales. Incremental penalties can be applied if required.

Each row in the table will contain the following fields :

- Number (auto-incremental)
- Date
- Time
- Penalty % (The % of the total score for the unit to be deducted as a penalty)
- Message (If the message field is not specified, then a default message will be generated - see below)

### Default Messages:

1: If a student opens a project after deadline or the student is working in the unit when deadline is reached

```Deadline X (the table row number) has been reached. This deadline carries a penalty of Y%. You can review your answers with no penalty. However, if you decide to change any answers by pressing the Modify button beneath a question, a Y% penalty deduction will be applied to your overall results. Once a modify button has been pressed once, the penalty deduction will be applied and you will be free to modify as many questions as you like with no additional penalty```

2: If a student presses a Modify button past a deadline

```Deadline X (the table row number) has been reached. This deadline carries a penalty of Y%. If you proceed, a Y% penalty deduction will be applied to your overall results. You will then be able to modify as many questions as you like with no additional penalty```

3: Final deadline (unit end date)

Once the final deadline hits (if one is set), the unit will be forced to read-only and then following message will be displayed to the student :

```You have exceeded the final deadline. You are no longer able to make changes to your answers. You are free to review your answers.```

### Teacher/Instructors Dashboard:

**Penalty indicator:** If a penalty was applied then the grade field will have a light red background. This should be the case even if no grade has been calculated yet. Hover above the field to see the penalty details (#, date/time, penalty %).

**Final grade field:** this field will show the final graded score less any penalty deduction. If the field is overwritten by the teacher/instructor, then the penalty deduction will not be applied.

### Adjusting deadline for individual students

The set deadline(s) can be adjusted forward by a number of days if required for individual students.

Select the unit from the class units list and click on the 3 blue vertical dots and select 'Adjust deadline'

You can then adjust the deadline forward by as many days as you require

When applied, the adjustment will then show next to the grade field in the teacher/instructors dashboard. The deadline in the image below was adjusted by 4 days
