title: Set unit duration


---

You can specify a start and a stop date and time for a unit. The unit will be disabled prior to the start date at which point it becomes available to students in their dashboard.

Once the stop date and time is reached you can set the unit to be marked as complete and/or disabled. If you elect to disable access, then depending on your [disabled Unit settings](/classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/disable) students will either be refused all access or can have read-only access to the Unit.

Please note, that selecting mark as complete will not stop students who have not started the unit from being able to access the unit after the stop date/time has been reached. If you wish to manage this, look at using the disable unit and mark as complete option.

This feature is accessible via the main settings tab.

# Penalties

If applying penalties for late submission it is recommended that you set the end date/time for the unit to the last date/time of your penalties.
You can set the penalty date/time after the unit end date/time but for students to then be able to work you will need to change the individual students unit status from [Completed](/classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/complete-unit/) and also adjust the [deadline](/classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/penalties/) for each of them.
