Codio supports full integration with any Learning Management System that supports the LTI interface. Codio supports LTI 1.0 and LTI 1.3. We have detailed documentation on how to integrate with the platforms below but many others are also supported.

Please note if students are using using **Safari** browser, they should disable "Prevent cross-site tracking" to ensure access.
