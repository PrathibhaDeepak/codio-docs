title: "Grading"


---
When grades are [released](/classes/monitor/grading/) a URL is passed to the LMS where students/teachers can access the grading information for the unit in the grading area of the LMS

By default, only the class teachers and the individual student can access the grading preview URL but by enabling the [LMS shared feedback](/classes/classmanagement/lmsfeedback) option for the class
