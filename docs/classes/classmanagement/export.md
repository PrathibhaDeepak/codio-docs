### Class Data
Class data (including students workspaces) can be exported. We would recommend the data is exported before you [Delete a Class](/classes/classmanagement/delete/)

- Select the class, go to the **Admin** area and then press the **Class Data** button.

- All the data from the class will be compiled into a zip file in the background and when ready an email will be sent to you with a link for you to download.

- The link will be active for 7 days and after this time the zip file will be removed

- You can also access any active files to download (and generate a new export if required) by clicking on the **Class Data** button

Individual units data can also be exported separately if required. See [export unit data](/classes/unitmanagement/settings#exportunitdata) for more details

If your class is LTI enabled you can also download all the unit LTI intergration URL's in a csv file. See [Exporting LTI settings](/classes/lti/lti1_0/keys#exportlti) for more information.


### User Access Data
Use this to download a CSV of user access to units in the class. Details include

- Username
- Users registered email address
- First name
- Last name
- Date/time when user logged in
- Access type (Log In, Log Out, Project Open, Project Close)
- Unit name (n.b Book based units will report the name of the book)
- Role in class (ie Teacher/Student)
- Project path
- IP address (IP address associated with login session)


- Select the class, go to the **Admin** area and then press the **Export User Access Data** button.

Collection and storage of this data started 29th Jan and will be retained for maximum of 6 months.

### LTI Settings
For more information see [Exporting LTI settings](/classes/lti/lti1_0/keys/)

### Working with student workspaces

If in the future you have need to review any students workspace, these can be imported back into your Codio account.
Simply 'zip' up the folder and you can then import the project into your account. See [creating and importing a project](/project/creating/) for more information.

Please note, the stack used in the original workspace is not included in the exported workspace so if you need to 'run' the project you should select the appropriate stack either when importing the project or by switching the stack, either from the gear icon in the main projects listing or by going to **Project>Stack>Settings** in the project
