title: Class contact url


---

Contact URL's can be set at the class level so if you have specific areas/forums for your classes for students to raise questions, you can set the contact URL's there and it will override the [organisation contact url](/dashboard/create/orgcontacturl) if set. You can set as many options as you require and also define the default option that will be checked automatically for the students.

Students will then be shown all the options in addition to contact Codio directly if they have a problem accessing the Codio platform, or loading a unit.

- Select the class, go to the **Admin** area and **Edit Details** where you can then enter the text and URL's to direct students to when they use any of the Contact us options.

**N.B. "Teacher" accounts will not be effected by this setting and they will still be able to contact Codio in the usual manner. See [Support](/dashboard/support/) for more on this**
