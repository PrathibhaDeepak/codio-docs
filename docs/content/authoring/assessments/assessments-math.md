title: "Math assessments"


---

Codio allows you to set and grade math questions for any type and level of mathematics. As of September 2017, we only offer manual grading of mathematical expressions or proofs.

If you require math assessments, please [contact us](/dashboard/support/) and we can arrange to enable this for your organisation

## Manually graded assessments using free text
To create a manually graded math question, you can use the **Free text** assessment type. This allows the students to enter expressions or even full proofs and worked answers using Latex. For more information about Latex, please [click here](/content/authoring/page-edit/latex/).

You can enter Latex in the **Question** and **Answer rationale** fields.

You should also set the **Preview type** drop down to either **Plaintext + Latex** or **Markdown + Latex**. Both of these ensure that the student sees a preview pane beneath their answer entry fully rendered in markdown and/or Latex. Please [click here](/content/authoring/assessments/assessments-free/) to review the free text assessment.

## Multiple choice
You can also use the multiple choice assessment type to create answers containing properly rendered Latex expressions.
