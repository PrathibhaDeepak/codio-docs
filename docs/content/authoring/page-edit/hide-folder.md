title: "Hiding folders"


---

Your content will often want to show code samples. Codio's recommended approach is to put each set of code samples into a dedicated folder. Then, using **Show Folders** on [page settings ](/content/authoring/settings-actions/page#show-hide), you can specify this folder. All non-specified folders are hidden from view in the file tree.
